In this captivating game, you'll assume the role of one of four characters: the valiant King, the cunning Thief, the powerful Mage, or the stalwart Warrior. Your mission? Guide the King to the throne, a task fraught with challenges.

Beware the obstacles that lie in wait – fire traps, walls, gates, and even lurking orcs. Unlike these static obstacles, mischievous dwarves are on the move, adding an element of dynamism to the gameplay. But fear not, for each character has unique strengths:

The Warrior is your weapon against trolls, striking them down with skill.
Keys dropped by defeated orcs become a lifeline for the nimble Thief, enabling gate-opening maneuvers.
The Mage's mastery over magic extends to erasing fire traps, clearing a safe path.
As for the King, well, his significance is evident as the centerpiece of your quest.
To facilitate your journey, teleporters await, offering swift passage to distant locales. However, the game introduces two types of items, each with its own twist:

One type alters time, either adding precious moments or slyly subtracting them – a test of your luck and resourcefulness.
The second type is considerably more impactful, eliminating all dwarves from the field, a truly magnificent game-changer.
Prepare to engage in a strategic, fantasy-laden escapade that demands wit, timing, and a dash of chance. Can you navigate the obstacles, outsmart the dwarves, and usher the King to his rightful throne? The adventure awaits!
